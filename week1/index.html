        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>How to Rewire You Brain</h3>
        <p>The paradigm shift. We need to train our brains <br>
        so that we can continue to understand the new technology. Do mobile first. <br>
        responsive retrofitting, making something one way to then change it for something else. <br>
         if you choose mobile first the downside is its time consuming and costly <br>
        for a full rebuild. But it provides the best experince accross many devices. <br>
        It addresses the constraints of the mobile size/bandiwdth. <br>
        Its future friendly and ready for growth. Desktops aren't as popular anymore if we want <br>
        to sell to the demand. Start samll and scale up! Mobile isn't going anywhere. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>How to Improve Mobile UX by Understanding Users.</h3>
        <p>It's really hard to design product by focus groups. A lot of times, <br>
        people don't know what they want until you show it to them. -Steve Jobs <br>
        Be there. Be useful. Be quick. Immediate. Relevant. Frictionless. <br>
        Reachability matters. Speed matters you will need ot make sure your stuff loads quick. <br>
        How to make it load fast? Reduce image usage throughout sites/apps. <br>
        Use SVG/Webfonts they are lower in bandwidth. Optimize and minify <br>
        CSS and JS  files, remove unused tags or unused codes so you don't have <br>
        to load unnecessary code and remove white space. Use GZIP files to eleminate <br>
        unnecessary data. </p>
        <h3>Better Mobile UX With Strategic Menu Design.</h3>
        <p>When creating a menu keep in mind about the reachability. Always strive to be amazing! <br>
        Menu with a border is the most effective. There are a lot of people who don't know <br>
        all the logos. Hit your users right in the happies!</p>
        <h3>Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</h3>
        <p>Make it easy. When making forms think of someone who hasn't used this before <br>
        and only have questions that you actually need. Enable auto complete on forms. <br>
        Auto advance for the user and include the spaces for the card numbers. <br>
        Use the proper kayboard for numbers! Save the number as an anchor tag so all they ahve to do is tap!</p>
        <h3>Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience</h3>
        <p>We are still using advertisement sizes for desktop, we need to use mobile size. <br>
        Pop ups are the worst for mobile. Make it that the ads are small and after being tapped <br>
        become larger to read.  Stop using pop-ups/pop-overs. Users don't visit your site <br>
        for ads only for content. Keep it simple and sleek. Empathy is huge when creating sites.</p>
