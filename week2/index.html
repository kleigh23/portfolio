        <h2>Questions</h2>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>Comments in JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
        // Single line comment 
        <br>
        /* Multiple <br>
        line <br>
        comment */</p>
        <h3>About "let" and "const"</h3>
        <p>using let or const to declare variables will ensure they are block scoped, <br>
        and it is good practice tp always use them to declare variables. <br>
        In general, if a value is unlikelt to change in your code then you should <br>
        declare it using const, and let should only be used for storing values <br>
        that will need to be reassigned while the program is running.</p>
        <h3>Backslashes</h3>
        <p>Single quote marks \' <br>
        Double quote marks \" <br>
        End of the line \n <br>
        Carriage return \r <br>
        tab \t <br>
        If you wan to actually write a backslash, you need to escape it with another backslash.</p>
        <h3>Logical Operators</h3>
        <p>! (Logical NOT) <br>
        && (Logical AND) <br>
        || (Logical OR) <br>

        </p>
        <h3>Pop, Push, Shift, and Unshift</h3>
